# Get_Highlight_Annotation
A Python project can extract highlights and annotations from a PDF file. The records will be kept in a CSV file. By Runze
Notes: Change the file_path to your own file path
        Make sure the highlighted parts are not too much or too less, since the codes will only identify the highlighted parts and their annotation. 
        Best wishes!
